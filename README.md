# Clustering_NGOFundAllocation
Kmeans - on clusters of nations for fund allocation

The dataset is taken from KAGGLE : https://www.kaggle.com/code/vikarna/ngo-cluster-analysis/data

Problem Statement : Generate a list of nations in need of support from a non-governmental organisation(NGO) named HELP International based on socioeconomic and health parameters. 


Interpretation of the result:

There are 3 clusters of countries obtained from K-means. 
Cluster 3 contains countries with highest child_mortality, higher imports and fertility, moderate to high inflation, and, lower exports, life_expectancy, health, gdp, and,  income. 

Hence, the reason that cluster number 3 was chosen for funding was due to the reasons that it contains the least developed countries, while cluster 2 contains upper and highly developed nations and Cluster 1 contains developing/ middle developed nations.
